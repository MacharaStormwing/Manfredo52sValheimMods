**Customizable Camera**

    This mod's main purpose is to give the player freedom in modifying their player camera in ways that they want to by allowing you to choose the position that their camera should be at as well as the camera FOV for different scenarios such as when standing, crouching or when sailing a boat! There are other features in this mod that may interest you as well such as a bow zoom feature or changing the camera distance for certain scenarios.

**Features**

    Change the X, Y, and Z positions as well as the FOV of the camera for several scenarios. Some examples being when you are standing still, crouching, sailing a boat, or when using a bow.
    Maximum camera distance values for normal gameplay and when sailing a boat can be edited.
    Option to change camera smoothing which determines how quickly the camera should follow the player.
    A smooth camera zoom feature that, if enabled, makes swapping camera distances much smoother than in the vanilla game, eliminating the abrupt change from one camera distance to another when changing distances with your scroll wheel.
    Bow zoom feature, that when enabled, allows you to zoom in when you are holding a bow and can be customized with several options.
    Feature to automatically change your camera distance for various conditions such as going into interiors or when starting control of a ship.
    Shoulder swap feature with the press of a dedicated key.
    A majority of these options and features can be customized to your liking.

**Installation**

Instructions for installing the mod. It can either be done manually or by using a mod manager.

    Install BepinEx﻿
    Install Configuration Manager OR BepinEx Configuration Manager
    Mod Manager install
    Manual install by placing .dll file into BepinEx/plugins folder

****Compatibility**

I cannot ensure compatibility for every mod out there but for a lot of the options in the config, you can enable and disable whatever you want so it works ﻿well with other mods. I developed this mod with compatibility in mind, especially for first person view mods.
Configuration

The config BepInEx/config/manfredo52.CustomizableCamera should generate in your config folder after running the game. I highly recommend using the configuration manager for changing values in-game. You can see all of the configuration settings below.
